# UTHAYAKUMAR_MUSIC-PLAYER 🎧

**Music Player UI** — a minimal, responsive music player interface built with HTML & CSS.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

A simple, stylish music player UI showcasing a cover image, song info, progress bar, and playback controls. This project is intended as a UI template or starting point for building a full-featured web music player.

## ✨ Features

- Clean, responsive card-style player
- CSS-only design (no JavaScript required to view the UI)
- Gradient background and animated button hover effects
- Easy to customize (cover image, song title, artist, styles)

## 🖼 Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the player.

Example:

```bash
# with VS Code Live Server extension
# 1. Install Live Server
# 2. Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
```

Or simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Uthayakumar74/UTHAYAKUMAR_MUSIC-PLAYER.git
cd UTHAYAKUMAR_MUSIC-PLAYER
```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser or use Live Server for live reload.

3. Customize by editing the HTML/CSS:
- Replace the background image in the `.cover` element
- Update the song title and artist in `.song-info`
- Add JavaScript later to manage real playback and dynamic progress
